# Natural-Disasters 

Embarks on a journey to explore two powerful natural forces—wildfires and earthquakes—through data. It starts in California, where wildfire incidents between 2013 and 2020 are mapped out, each one telling a story of devastation and resilience. By analyzing over 1,600 records, the project paints a vivid picture of how wildfires have shaped the landscape, using visualizations like dot and density plots to reveal patterns in where and how severely these fires have burned. The goal is not just to understand their past impact, but to provide insights that could help prevent future disasters. The project then shifts its focus to a global scale, examining the earth's seismic activity. With 1,000 earthquake records from around the world, each quake is plotted on a map, allowing us to see the regions most affected by these powerful natural events. Like the wildfires, earthquakes leave behind clues in their timing, magnitude, and location, and this analysis helps uncover those hidden patterns. Through engaging visualizations, the project offers a glimpse into the world’s most active seismic zones, connecting data to the stories of survival and recovery.
